Use Cases : 
  - Extracted from requirements
  - Express use case with few words 
  - Details can come later 
  - this approach  will made communication with team esier 

How to extract use Case : 
  - from requirements we extrat them by going throw  line by line 
  - Looking for Verbs 
  - we may extract same use case from defferant requirement
  - Some use case indicate at some missing part of others use cases 
    . For Example : 
      + for ever word like 
        add/Create or her sister (edit/Modify remove/Delete) 
        we may have use case for edit/Modify , remove/Delete
  - We may have same use case with same name but for defferant user 
    . For Example : 
      + UseCase 1 (User1)
        UseCase 1 (User2)
  - we add under use case name the data or some detail it use in {}
   (Note : this is my preferance not golbal or sentific way )
  - finaly Clean up by grouping use case in general title or big use case
